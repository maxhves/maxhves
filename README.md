### Hi, I'm Maximilian.

I have been working professionally as a Software Engineer for eight years, specializing in building scalable, high-performance, and ergonomic applications. My expertise spans native mobile development, backend and frontend development, as well as API and database design and integration.

I have a deep passion for solving complex technical challenges, backed by a strong foundation in programming fundamentals and a solid grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms.

Most of the time, youâ€™ll find me working with Kotlin and TypeScript, while also exploring Python to integrate AI technologies into my products and workflows.
