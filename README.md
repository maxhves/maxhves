### Hey there, I'm Maximilian! 👋

<p>
I love to build solutions to problems and as a very observant person, I am always able to create detailed and intuitive solutions that truly cater to the needs of the user.

I have been working as a Software Engineer in a professional capacity for 8 years, and throughout that time I have amassed a diverse set of technical skills. 

Predominantly my experience has been in the realm of native mobile applications, more specifically, Android applications, however through my own interest and personal projects, I have gained experience in creating solutions that span the entire full stack.

Seeing the impact of the work that I do is a great motivator for me, and I thoroughly enjoy receiving feedback from customers that help to grow and improve the product. Working with meaningful and impactful projects is something that I am always on the lookout for.
