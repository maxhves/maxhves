### Hey, I'm Maximilian

I have been working as a Software Engineer full-time for seven years, during which I have developed a diverse set of skills and strong problem-solving abilities.

My primary experience lies in developing native mobile applications, specifically for Android. However, my personal projects and endeavors have given me a comprehensive understanding of the entire stack, along with a keen eye for design.

I am passionate about working on meaningful projects and witnessing the positive impact my work has on users and customers.

Outside of development, I enjoy staying fit and am an avid traveler. I have visited over twenty countries and have lived in five different countries.
