### Hi there, I'm Max 👋

I'm a **Senior Android Developer** originally from the **UK**, currently living and working in **Oslo, Norway**. As well as being passionate about Kotlin and Android, I am a talented, experienced problem solver and developer I have a clear user-experienced-based focus, enjoying creating the best UX experience I can. I strongly believe that solving the root cause to an issue is better than surpressing the symptoms.

I have a strong **Computer Science** background that affords me the ability to work with a plethora of languages and allows me to adapt to unfamiliar and new environments. I have a very strong bias towards **Kotlin** and **Java** and I love contributing to mine and others' open source projects.
